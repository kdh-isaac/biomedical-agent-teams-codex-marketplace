# Biomedical Agent Teams Quickstart

Use this page when you need the smallest working BMAT workflow shape. The full
router remains in `skills/biomedical-agent-teams/SKILL.md`.

## Pick A Workflow

- `biomedical-research-council`: broad research synthesis or multi-axis routing.
- `idea-discovery-team`: hypothesis generation, ranking, and kill-test planning.
- `omics-analysis-team`: public omics feasibility, run, or audit.
- `evidence-audit-team`: claim, citation, provenance, or report defensibility.
- `experiment-design-team`: wet-lab or computational validation design.
- `translational-scout-team`: clinical, regulatory, IP, or competitive scouting.

## Pick A Mode

- `quick`: compact answer with explicit assumptions and claim boundary.
- `standard`: preflight, source/claim boundary, and selected specialist lanes.
- `deep`: full audit gates, workflow state, and post-write validation.
- `audit`: pass / pass-with-revisions / block verdict for existing material.
- `plan`: omics planning without full execution.
- `run`: omics execution with S1-S5 gates and reviewer-floor policy.

## Examples

```text
biomedical-research-council TET2 KO plus IL-21 armored CAR-T persistence --mode standard
```

```text
omics-analysis-team public datasets for IL-21-STAT3-FOXO1 stem-like CAR-T signatures --mode plan
```

```text
evidence-audit-team "IL-21 armored TET2 KO CAR-T suppresses exhaustion through FOXO1" --mode audit
```

```text
experiment-design-team FOXO1 dependency of TET2 KO plus IL-21 armored CAR-T persistence --mode deep
```

## Scaffold A Bundle

```bash
python skills/biomedical-agent-teams/scripts/bmat_init_bundle.py \
  --workflow evidence-audit-team \
  --mode audit \
  --topic "audit FOXO1 dependency claim" \
  --out ./bmat_runs/foxo1_audit
```

Then fill the generated `preflight.json`, `source_corpus.json`,
`claim_ledger.json`, `stage_evaluation.json`, and `post_write_validation.json`
before claiming `Compact standard workflow` or `Full protocol followed`.

## Smoke Test

```bash
python skills/biomedical-agent-teams/scripts/bmat_selftest.py --root .
```

The self-test runs package layout checks, loop policy validation, a valid bundle
validation, and the offline golden-eval sample without requiring `pytest`.
