# Workflow Run Template

Use for deep, audit, omics run, translational, manuscript-support,
generated-file, or long-running BMAT workflows. Keep the run state compact
enough to paste into a final answer or save as a local artifact.

| field | value |
|---|---|
| run_id | BMAT-RUN-YYYYMMDD-001 |
| alias | biomedical-research-council / idea-discovery-team / omics-analysis-team / evidence-audit-team / experiment-design-team / translational-scout-team |
| mode | quick / standard / deep / audit / plan / run |

| execution_strategy | inline_only / inline_first_selective_review / team_level_selective_dag / user_requested_full_spawn / blocked |
| nested_spawn_allowed | false / true-with-explicit-approval |
| final_label | Full protocol followed / Compact standard workflow / Biomedical Agent Teams-informed narrative review / Partial workflow; formal gates skipped / Blocked |

## Spawned Review Lanes

| reviewer_role | status | rationale | ledger_handoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| claim-level-evidence-verifier | planned / running / complete / skipped / blocked |  |  |
| citation-verifier | planned / running / complete / skipped / blocked |  |  |
| contradiction-red-team | planned / running / complete / skipped / blocked |  |  |
| biostats-repro-auditor | planned / running / complete / skipped / blocked |  |  |

## Team Spawn Lanes

| team | phase | depends_on | status | nested_spawn_used | ledger_handoff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| idea-discovery-team | 1 | phase 0 | planned / running / complete / skipped / blocked | false |  |
| omics-analysis-team | 1 | phase 0 | planned / running / complete / skipped / blocked | false |  |
| translational-scout-team | 1 | phase 0 | planned / running / complete / skipped / blocked | false |  |
| experiment-design-team | 2 | narrowed candidate claims | planned / running / complete / skipped / blocked | false |  |
| evidence-audit-team | 2 | draft claims or results | planned / running / complete / skipped / blocked | false |  |

## Team Output Artifacts

Use this table for actual command-level spawned team bundle outputs. The
`team_spawn_lanes` table records the intended DAG; this table records the
completed output artifact that the lead can map into the central claim ledger.
For Phase 2+ team outputs, `depends_on_outputs` must reference complete prior
team artifact IDs.

| team | phase | artifact_id | path | status | input_scope | checks_run | ledger_handoff | depends_on_outputs | failure_or_downgrade_reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| idea-discovery-team | 1 | TEAM-IDEA-001 | team-outputs/idea-discovery-team.md | planned / running / complete / skipped / blocked / failed |  |  |  |  |  |
| experiment-design-team | 2 | TEAM-EXPERIMENT-001 | team-outputs/experiment-design-team.md | planned / running / complete / skipped / blocked / failed |  |  |  | TEAM-IDEA-001 |  |

## Spawned Agent Instances

Use this table for actual spawned reviewers or tool-backed validators. The
`spawned_review_lanes` table records intent; this table records reviewer or
validator instances that actually ran. Command-level team bundles are recorded
separately in `team_output_artifacts`.

| instance_id | agent_id | execution_surface | spawn_tool | thread_or_task_id | status | input_scope | output_artifact | checks_run | ledger_handoff | failure_or_downgrade_reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BMAT-SPAWN-001 | citation-verifier | spawned_subagent / tool_backed_validator / external_verifier / human_reviewer | multi_agent / cli / human |  | planned / running / complete / skipped / blocked / failed |  |  |  |  |  |
