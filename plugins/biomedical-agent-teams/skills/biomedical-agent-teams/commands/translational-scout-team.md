# Translational Scout Team

User request: $ARGUMENTS

Evaluate translational feasibility without turning weak evidence into clinical advice. Default to Korean.

## Team

- `protocol-context-locker`
- `entity-normalizer`
- `clinical-trial-operations-scout`
- `grant-ip-landscape-scout`
- `life-science-literature-curator`
- `central-claim-ledger-evidence-graph`
- `risk-of-bias-study-quality-auditor`
- `safety-ethics-privacy-dual-use-auditor`
- `causal-inference-confounder-analyst`
- `claim-level-evidence-verifier`
- `citation-verifier`
- `contradiction-red-team`
- `scientific-writer-citation-agent`
- `post-write-final-validator`

## Workflow

1. Run `protocol-context-locker`: translational question, deliverable, clinical/legal/regulatory boundary, evidence scope, risk/safety/privacy class, and approval gate.
2. Normalize disease, target, therapy type, biomarker, trial IDs, and comparator space.
3. Map trial landscape and operational feasibility.
4. Maintain `central-claim-ledger-evidence-graph` for each trial, biomarker, safety, IP, and competitive claim.
5. Check site-level and registry-status caveats when trial matching or recruitment is discussed.
6. Separate efficacy evidence, biomarker association, mechanism, safety, manufacturability, and competitive positioning.
7. Audit study quality/risk of bias, causal language, and evidence-to-decision uncertainty.
8. Run safety/ethics/privacy/dual-use audit for clinical, regulatory, IP, and patient-facing boundaries.
9. Flag regulatory, IP, and publication risks without providing legal or medical advice.
10. Verify claims and source identifiers before final synthesis.
11. Writer uses only verified ledger material; run `post-write-final-validator` before final output.

## Mode Routing

| Mode | Agent selection and depth |
|---|---|
| `quick` | Normalize target/indication/therapy concept, give non-advisory feasibility scan with explicit not-source-checked caveats if live verification was not done. |
| `standard` | Add literature/trial/IP landscape checks, central claim ledger, risk-of-bias, causal boundary, and claim/citation verification for key claims. |
| `deep` | Add full trial landscape, comparator space, operational bottlenecks, manufacturability/safety/regulatory/IP flags, contradiction red-team, safety auditor, and post-write validation. |
| `audit` | Audit an existing translational claim, deck, or strategy for source support, trial status, actionability overclaim, safety/regulatory/IP caveats, and clinical-advice boundaries. |

Safety auditor is mandatory for clinical, patient-facing, regulatory, patent/IP,
private project, controlled-access, or external-disclosure claims. Do not present
legal, regulatory, or medical advice; frame outputs as research support.

## Final Output

1. translational question
2. protocol/context lock
3. normalized entities and scope
4. central claim ledger summary
5. trial and competitive landscape
6. operational bottlenecks
7. safety/regulatory/IP flags
8. risk-of-bias and causal boundary
9. evidence strength and claim boundary
10. useful but excluded or not-ledger-verified claims
11. post-write validation verdict
12. recommended next translational action
