# Experiment Design Team

User request: $ARGUMENTS

Design a defensible validation plan. Default to Korean. Assume expert-level immunology and CAR cell therapy context.

## Required Preflight Contract

Before literature/database expansion, external tools, file writes, spawned-agent
claims, or final writing, produce or update runtime capability preflight and a
compact preflight contract with:
`requested_alias`, `selected_mode`, `deliverable_type`, `evidence_scope`,
`risk_class`, `required_role_outputs`, `skipped_role_outputs_with_reason`,
`external_tools_allowed`, `file_write_plan`, `stop_criteria`, and
`checkpoint_plan`. Also record `execution_strategy`,
`spawned_review_plan`, `team_spawn_plan`,
`all_role_spawn_avoidance_reason`, `nested_spawn_policy`, and
`post_team_audit_plan`. If runtime capability preflight or this contract is absent,
use the strongest downgraded workflow label supported by the produced artifacts
and runtime rather than a full experiment-design audit.

If shell/code execution is unavailable, or if `scripts/bmat_validate.py` cannot
be run because shell/code execution is unavailable, record
`validator_unavailable_due_to_runtime` in preflight, workflow-run downgrade
reasons, and final skipped gates. Do not claim `Full protocol followed` in that
state.

## Spawned Team Bundle Policy

This recipe may run as a selected team-level spawned subagent after the main
BMAT lead has narrowed the candidate hypothesis, claim, or design objective.
If spawned, run the internal roles inline, do not spawn child agents unless
`nested_spawn_policy` explicitly allows it, and return one formal
experiment-design team report. The report must include objective, experimental
unit, controls, readouts, sample-size logic, confounders, kill-tests,
feasibility gates, safety boundaries, confidence, files changed or `none`,
checks run or skipped, and a handoff for the central claim ledger.

## Team

- `protocol-context-locker`
- `life-science-lead-scientist`
- `entity-normalizer`
- `immunology-mechanism-critic`
- `causal-inference-confounder-analyst`
- `experimental-design-planner`
- `protocol-reagent-logistics-planner`
- `bayesian-decision-modeler`
- `biostats-repro-auditor`
- `risk-of-bias-study-quality-auditor`
- `safety-ethics-privacy-dual-use-auditor`
- `central-claim-ledger-evidence-graph`
- `contradiction-red-team`
- `figure-schematic-director`
- `claim-level-evidence-verifier`
- `citation-verifier`
- `scientific-writer-citation-agent`
- `post-write-final-validator`

## Workflow

1. Run runtime capability preflight to record browsing/database, file-write, shell, and spawned-subagent support.
2. Run `protocol-context-locker`: experimental objective, deliverable, safety/privacy class, feasibility boundary, approval gate, and stop criteria.
3. Run preliminary `entity-normalizer`.
4. Lock source corpus for source-backed rationale, methods, reagents, and prior-art claims.
5. Restate the hypothesis, mechanism, experimental unit, and success/failure criteria.
6. Build/update `central-claim-ledger-evidence-graph` for rationale, assumptions, and evidence gaps.
7. Identify the strongest causal kill-test and the most likely confounders.
8. Specify controls, biological replicates, technical replicates, donor/model considerations, randomization/blinding where feasible, and exclusion criteria.
9. Define readouts, timing, expected outcomes, alternative interpretations, and follow-up branches.
10. Add reagent/protocol/QC/logistics checks without inventing unknown reagent details.
11. Run safety/ethics/privacy/dual-use audit before operational details or external disclosure.
12. Use Bayesian decision modeling to prioritize the first experiment or staged validation route.
13. Run biostats, risk-of-bias/study-quality, red-team, claim, and citation gates before final recommendation.
14. For `deep` or `audit`, maintain workflow-run state and biomedical passport state and run the integrity gate before final recommendation.
15. Apply `references/independent-review-policy.md` before describing validation as independent.
16. Writer uses only verified ledger material; run `post-write-final-validator` before final output.
17. If this was a spawned team output, provide `spawned_team_output_status`,
    `nested_spawn_used`, and `ledger_handoff_claim_ids` before final wording.

## Mode Routing

| Mode | Agent selection and depth |
|---|---|
| `quick` | Restate hypothesis, experimental unit, core control, primary readout, and one strongest kill-test. Use compact final output. |
| `standard` | Add mechanism critic, causal/confounder review, design planner, sample-size logic, confounders, and staged go/no-go gates. Maintain compact claim ledger. |
| `deep` | Add protocol/reagent logistics, Bayesian decision model, biostats, risk-of-bias, contradiction red-team, safety auditor, claim/citation verification, figure plan, and post-write validation. |
| `audit` | Audit an existing plan for controls, biological unit, sample size, feasibility, safety/privacy, confounding, and claim strength before rewriting. |

Safety auditor is mandatory for operational wet-lab details, biosafety,
animal/human material, private project context, patent-sensitive strategy, or
external disclosure. Keep reagent/catalog specifics as unknown unless verified.
